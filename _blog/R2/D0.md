# D0

This is day 1 of #100DayOfCode Round 2. Admittedly I am a week into the challenge but am only now getting to journaling about it.

I am setting out to learn ChucK. It's a programming "strongly timed" programming language designed for creating music software. Under the hood it's C++, started in (I think) 2005 by Ge Wang et al at CalArts. The language is contributed to by maintainers from various respected universities across the USA. There's also a reasonable amount of public projects that use ChucK.

I have written music in DAWs for (as of 2022) a decand and a half. I always liked computers and thought that coding was "probably pretty cool." Music, specifically synthesis and DSP, were the reasons I thought that. I changed careers from "whatever" into software development in my mid/late 20s after I taught myself web dev at cafes in my evenings and weekends. It took me another three or four years before I ended up here - that's fine though. I am far better equipped to explore this world now that I have a proficient grasp of software engineering.

For those that know AWS CDK: Part of my work includes writing declarative infrastructure templates with TypeScript. When I found ChucK, it was clear to me that I was looking at the CDK of writing music. I've been on the hunt for a programming language that I can use to author declarative techno. And I found it.
