# #100DaysOfCode

This is my second round for #100DaysOfCode and as such you will see the `R2` prefix on file names. The `D5` portion signifies the day of the challenge.

To run these files:

- install chuck if needed
- there is a pulse-audio version of chuck
  - get up and running faster
  - will experience audible playback artifacts
- prefer the jack version of chuck when possible
- run `chuck r2d4_main.ck`

The repo is set up in accordance with Helix architecture principles.
