#100DaysOfCode

This is my second round for #100DaysOfCode and as such you will see the `R2` prefix on file names.

To run these files:
* ensure that ChucK is installed on your machine, however you prefer to do that
* `chuck r2d4_run.ck`
* due to an idiosyncrasy with the ChucK interpretter, you cannot import a dependency and immediately use it. All dependencies must be aggregated in one root file. The convention is to call this `$projectName_run.ck`

File format follows R2D0 such that
* R2 = round 2
* D_ = day ___
