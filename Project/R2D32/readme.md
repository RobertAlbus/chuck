## Today's goals
### Make a ring mod
Read about the math, want to try implementing a Chugen that does it.

### Extend ring mod
- add a third signal to the mix
- make the coarse ratio increment by 1, the fine ratio can do the tuning between whole numbers
- add a LPF to the end of the signal chain with the cut off mapped to a knob with an exponentiated input transform
- create a waveform toggle that is mapped to a midi drum pad

## Today's outcomes
- Made a ring mod synth

## Lessons
- More MIDI knobs would be great
- OSC (Open Sound Control) is probably in my future
