## Today's goals
### make musical sounds
Use some of what is built and create something that sounds like techno

## Today's outcomes
- made a techno loop using cool instruments and step sequencers

## Lessons
- I can see a possible future in which I can use code to write electronic music that could fall into a genre that is prefixed with "minimal".
