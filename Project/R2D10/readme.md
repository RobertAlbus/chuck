# R2D10

## Today's goals

### explore a new pattern for the shape of Project modules

Expanding on yesterday's goal. Today I pulled forward the R2D9 lib and project so I can expand on it. I've suffixed the lib files with the respective days they belong to and also added a point version to the lib file I carried forward. I hope that this will be informative later when I look back over the Project modules for code and insight into how to create useful Foundation and Feature modules.

# try a new idea for declaratively triggering time-based instruments (such as the step sequencers)

I want to create declarative class(es) to internalize the "play next unit" functionality than managing and triggering in the main project loop. The time-unit and subsequent triggering action will be configurable and internalized to the tool.

## Today's outcomes

- for the most part I just refactored code into lib files
- also explored some concepts but I ran out of steam/time
- I can pull forward R2D10 lib files in future days if they are relevant
