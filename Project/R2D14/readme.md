## Today's goals

### Extend UGen and play with tick() function
- just play with it and see what I can learn

## Today's outcomes
- Created a class that extends Ugen, then Chugen

## Lessons
- UGen doesn't automatically tick() but Chugen does
- I need to pipe input into a Chugen for the tick function to receive a non-zero value
