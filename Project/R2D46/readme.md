# R2D45

## Today's goals
### Add chords and lead synth to yesterday's project
Keep adding on to the existing project to build a more robust songlike thing.

## Today's outcomes
- Added chords

## Lessons / Thoughts
- I could create a standard lib of "assigner-functions" for presets of Instruments
  - if this is robust enough, I could create algo-music
  - shouldn't have the performance bottleneck that string parsing in ChucK has
  - could also create "generator-functions" for pseudo/random presets
- I could create a standard lib of "common patterns"
  - if this is robust enough, I could create algo-music
