# R2D45

## Today's goals
### make musical sounds
Keep adding on to the existing pattern to build a more robust songlike thing.

## Today's outcomes
- modified yesterday's project by adding additional patterns for the step sequencers
- added (but did not use) an additional pluck synth that uses the same voice as the bass pluck

## Lessons
- I was hot on the trigger with creating lib files, as far as this repo structure is concerned. 
  - refactoring modules in the Foundation and Feature layers could result in breaking Projects
  - there is minimal intellisense support for ChucK to facilitate refactoring across Projects
  - !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
  - this confirms my pivot to copy/paste approach at the Project level
- In the future I could have a repo per EP/album/project/sonic-space
  - copy forward the most useful libs
  - create one-off libs or test-pilot ideas on a per-repo basis
  - do not let it live on for 100 Projects LMFAO
