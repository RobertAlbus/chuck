## Today's goals
### Explore the type system again and sketch out a good base class for instruments


## Today's outcomes
- created a minimal base class for instruments
- created a singleton Time class for inter-shred time utils

## Lessons
- interfaces would be great for polymorphism, but a common base class can be a workable solution for some use cases (step sequencer for example)
