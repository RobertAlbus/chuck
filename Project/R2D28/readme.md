## Today's goals

### Get MIDI input from a controller
I can use MIDI knobs to control the various parameters of yesterday's patch. It might prove to be a more intuitive way of exploring the sonic range and emergent possibilities of that project

## Today's outcomes
- Read midi input from

## Lessons
- `aconnect -l` lists all MIDI devices on the system
- chucking `input device` to `now` progresses time by "some amount" (?.. way more than 1 sample, but idk) for every midi event.
- have a hunch that ChucK's MIDI interpretation is way less sophisticated than that used by a DAW
