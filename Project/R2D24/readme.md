## Today's goals

### Try out the Chubgraph class
- This is looks like the right thing to use for input=>output based modules
- start by validating the concept, then consider some nice multi-effects or waveshaping

### Consider APIs for polyphonic interaction
- I might want to spork a shred for each note instance, and then progress time by the specified amount
- I should probabyl watch the Kadenze tutorials on shreds/events/etc
