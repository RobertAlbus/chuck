## Lessons / Thoughts
- yesterday's automation clip is great, but the time constraint sucks
  - can only specify time fractions that satisfy `2^-N` where N is a natural number
  - I need to come up with a decent composition methodogy (leveraging variable naming) to constrain values in an easy to read/write format
