# R2D50

## Today's goals

### Integrate new utils into R2D50 file structure
* R2D50 implements a potential repo structure
* Initial repo structure I chose did not end up suiting the class hierarchies
* When creating R2D50 I sandboxed my decisions about the new lib structure inside R2D50
* This allows one to not worry about breaking compatibility for previous project with later refactors
* I made more utilities in the past week and I want to add them to this library structure
