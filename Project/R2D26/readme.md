# R2D26

## Today's goals

### Try out the Chubgraph class

### Create a clipper UGen
Create a UGen with some basic params for pre/post gain, threshold, whatever else makes sense

## Today's outcomes
- created a clipper

## Lessons
- touchpad on my laptop doesn't play nice with the mouse events that work on my desktop computer.
- ChucK has a hard time doing a lot of sample-level processing I guess?
- chubgraph works how you'd expect. It doesn't have tick, but it has an inlet UGen and an outlet UGen
