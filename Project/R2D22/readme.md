# R2D22

## Today's goals

### Combine multiple OscSynthSingle into OscSynthMulti (the new way)

### Try out the Chubgraph class
- I think this is what I need to use for Chugens with an input, such as R2D19's echo effect
- it has `inlet` and `outlet` property
- this should mean that we don't have to push the incoming tick value onto a Step or Impulse
