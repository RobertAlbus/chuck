## Today's goals

### Make automation clip
should be able to select the wave shape, including noise.
Might be worthwhile to generalize the "select wave shape" utility because that is also used in the OscSynthSingle.
Should try to figure out how to re-trigger the osc phase.


## Today's outcomes
- Added centerVal to LFO so the LFO value can be offset by a certain amount if desired
- Used the LFO on the pitch of a sine so that I could hear it in action
