# R2D45

## Today's goals
### Add pattern toggle to each instrument
Add toggles to instruments that can be triggered with MIDI. This allows me to jam on the song in a mroe arrangement-like fashion.
Didn't get to the pattern-toggle in R2D47

## Today's outcomes
- Added a MidiTestMode flag to toggle between:
  - printing midi control values one at a time
  - playing the composition
